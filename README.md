- 👋 Hi, I’m @idalmasso
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, standalone development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, but also taking a look to python framework django. Would like in future to take a look in ruby on rails and refresh my c++ going full into c++20
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything backend related and possibly interesting in the algorithmic scope
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me @ ivano.dalmasso@gmail.com
